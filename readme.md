**Welcome to my TalkLikeSnoop Alexa Skill!**
=================================

**Purpose:**

On October 15th, I saw that Amazon was running a promotion to develop a new Alexa skill,
and in return you would win a free 3rd generation Echo Dot if you submitted and
were approved prior to Halloween! I was super excited by the challenge and I had
a lot of fun putting this together.

**Goals:**

My goal was to develop an algorithm that would take a phrase said by the user and
translate each individual word to its "izzle" form. For example contrary becomes
"contrizzle."

**Reflections:**
I found that certain words worked better than others, and I had to modify the
algorithm for different cases. For example, words that began with vowels generally
didn't izzle as well as words that began with consonants. I also changed the algorithm
so if a word ends with "ed," then it becomes "izzled." The same thing goes for "ing"
 becoming "izzling," and "s" becoming "izzles."

**For feedback:**

Please do not hesitate to message me if you see anything that looks out of place, or could be improved.

I am always looking to get better as a software developer, and I welcome any constructive criticism.
